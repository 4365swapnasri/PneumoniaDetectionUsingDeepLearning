Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning models to classify chest X-ray images.
# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify X-ray scans as either normal or indicative of pneumonia.

## Introduction

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be diagnosed through chest X-ray imaging. This project aims to automate the detection process using deep learning techniques, potentially aiding medical professionals in faster and more accurate diagnoses.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle. It contains a large collection of chest X-ray images categorized into "NORMAL" and "PNEUMONIA".

-   The dataset is organized into `train`, `test`, and `val` folders.
-   Each folder contains subfolders for `NORMAL` and `PNEUMONIA` images.

Please download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data` directory of this project.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia-detection.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia-detection.git)
    cd pneumonia-detection
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file should contain the following:

    ```
    tensorflow
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    numpy
    opencv-python
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Prepare the dataset:**
    -   Ensure the dataset is downloaded and placed in the `data` directory.

2.  **Train the model:**

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

    This script will train the CNN model using the training data and validate it using the validation data.

3.  **Evaluate the model:**

    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

    This script will evaluate the trained model on the test data and print the evaluation metrics.

4.  **Make predictions:**

    ```bash
    python predict.py path/to/image.jpg
    ```

    Replace `path/to/image.jpg` with the path to the X-ray image you want to classify.

## Model Architecture

The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The architecture may vary, but a basic example might include:

-   Convolutional layers with ReLU activation.
-   Max pooling layers.
-   Flatten layer.
-   Fully connected layers.
-   Output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

The model can be modified and improved by changing the number of layers, filter sizes, and other hyperparameters.

Example of a simple model using Keras/Tensorflow:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
